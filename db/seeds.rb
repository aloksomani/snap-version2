# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# To seed the HABTM for Profiles and Cameras, seed the profiles one by one
# while assigning variable names to each profile. Then see each camera while
# assigning variable names to each camera. Finally, shovel the correct profile 
# into each camera and save. The whole process should look like this:
# landscape = Profile.create({style:'landscape'})
# a6000 = Camera.new({attributes})
